## Overview

This project was about using sub-buffers to copy the average for different steps of our 
buffer. We run our kernel to compute all continuous subsequences of length 4 given average. 
This results in a nice counter sequence for our output. Since everything is constant length
and the assignment is testing usage of sub buffers it doesn't make sense to produce
a timing comparsion.
